Things playing, noise, changes, even music can capture your attention and keep it away from the task at hand. Sure, it might not be a big deal but sometimes, it can keep you also from doing your best work. Getting distracted can be a bit risky - if youre handling a knife or a sharp object, you need to focus more on whatever you are doing to avoid an accident or a small mishap. When doing tasks that require precision, it's also important to pay attention."

Even unpleasant or difficult activities can be enjoyed more if we give them our full attention. Being present in the moment is what helps us stay engaged and reduce worries about the past or the future. It can help us be more present and live our lives in a genuine way.

When we try to multitask, we just switch quickly between the different elements. Especially if there are constant changes, like shifts in the voice of the person speaking or just the shift between one song and the next, will attract your focus.

We deny our brain the chance to explore and consider the different things brewing inside and often also deny ourselves the insights it could bring. When we allow ourselves to be silent and listen to ourselves with no distractions, we can have some amazing experiences, discover new things about who we are and what we want. Silence can promote reflection, so it's important we are not always blasting our thoughts away with music."

While music isn't always a big enough distraction to count as multitasking, having something in the background can lead to our brain operating in a multitask mode, which can hurt performance. And the sneakiest thing about multitasking is that we don't notice how much it affects us. Overall, having music or a book or a podcast in the background can make routine, physical tasks easier. But sometimes, it can also interfere with work, creativity, and productivity, as well as Introspection and reflection. It's important to give our brain a chance to just be with its thoughts and focus fully on the task at hand."
